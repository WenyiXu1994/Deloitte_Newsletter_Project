Instead of room bookings, Marriott International deal with Grab focuses on about 600 restaurants and bars at its properties in the six Southeast Asian countries, which will start being added to GrabFood’s on-demand delivery platform in November. The Marriott-Grab integration means the two companies will link their loyalty programs, so GrabRewards points can be converted to Marriott Bonvoy points, or vice versa.

Social media platforms — quickly replacing publishers as the “front end” of news — act as an accelerant, using likes and reads to pattern-match content to readers. The message is clear: If people want to continue consuming news, they and media companies need to work together to develop a business model that can support it. This is where claims of “fake news” originate: Dividing the world into free facts versus paywalled facts means we are increasingly talking past each other.

And the search volume being up on Apple’s crawler is something that Jon Henshaw of Coywolf had noted back in August. Making Siri a one-stop shop could inoculate Apple in the scenario where they are forced to enable a search provider choice in the iOS onboarding flow by regulation. It won’t do anything to help Google though, which pays Apple billions because iOS users are worth way more than any other mobile web users to its business.

      "Summary: TikTok’s strange, unprecedented twists and turns take place against the backdrop of significant changes to social media itself, as it evolves from a medium for sharing into a one-to-many broadcast medium for the digital age. TikTok’s efforts to monetize its platform can tell us a lot about the future of not only the social media business, but also of TV and one-to-many media in general. TikTok wins a seat at the tableSome of the first major social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and LinkedIn, were built to help users create and share media within finite circuits of followers. Such real-life social connections, as the “social media” moniker suggests, were the core of these platforms’ user experiences, distribution frameworks, and monetization models. If it can’t, it will end up in in the social media graveyard alongside MySpace, Friendster, and Vine.\n",

      "Summary: During experiments, the researchers say their Transporter Networks achieved “superior” efficiency on a number of tasks including stacking a pyramid of blocks, assembling kits, manipulating ropes, and pushing piles of small objects. The Google study coauthors say Transporter Networks don’t require any prior 3D model, pose, or class category knowledge of the objects to be manipulated, instead relying only on information contained within partial depth camera data. The researchers trained Transporter Networks on datasets of demonstrations ranging in number from one demonstration to 1,000 per task. Then they validated the Transporter Networks on kit assembly tasks using real UR5e robots with suction grippers and cameras including an Azure Kinect. The Transporter Networks, which were trained with 11,633 pick-and-place actions total on all tasks from 13 human operators, achieved 98.9% success in assembling kits of bottled mouthwashes.\n",
