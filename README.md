# Deloitte_Newsletter_Project
This is an internship project that I did at Deloitte Data Intelligence Team. No confidential information is included.  

This project aims to generate a short daily newsletter that contains the headlines of many reputable tech news websites.

    2. This file is also used to generate daily newsletter content.  (the output file is '20201029_news.txt')
