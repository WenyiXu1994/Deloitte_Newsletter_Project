# Deloitte_Newsletter_Project
This is an internship project that I did at Deloitte Data Intelligence Team. No confidential information is included.  

This project aims to generate a short daily newsletter that contains the headlines of many reputable websites.  

There are two main parts of this project,  

1. Get headline news content from reputable news sites  
   Web_scrapping_from_different_news_websites.ipynb:  This file is used to get the titles and the body of all headline news from different websites.  

2. Categorize news into different topics, including AI, blockchain, self-driving, etc..  
    keyword_matching.ipynb: This file is used to categorize the news by keywords matching.  (The key words libraries are in the folder 'word dictionaries')  
    Classify_all_the_news.ipynb: This file is used to do topic analysis using the LDA model. This is used to confirm the categorizing results of keywords matching.  

Note: Part of the codes are written in Chinese. This is because this project is done with Deloitte China.
