Summary: To meet some of that challenge, today, LinkedIn is launching a new Career Explorer tool to help people find new jobs. The Career Explorer tool is perhaps the most interesting of the new features. It notes that a food server and a customer service specialist (an in-demand job) have a 71% skills overlap. LinkedIn said that to date, around 13 million people have used the those tools to learn new skills for the most in-demand jobs. It helps keep that jobs business evolving at a time when it otherwise might feel somewhat stagnant.

Social media platforms ¡ª quickly replacing publishers as the ¡°front end¡± of news ¡ª act as an accelerant, using likes and reads to pattern-match content to readers. The message is clear: If people want to continue consuming news, they and media companies need to work together to develop a business model that can support it. This is where claims of ¡°fake news¡± originate: Dividing the world into free facts versus paywalled facts means we are increasingly talking past each other.

Summary: Apple is now showing its own search results and linking directly to websites when users type queries from its home screen in iOS 14. And the search volume being up on Apple¡¯s crawler is something that Jon Henshaw of Coywolf had noted back in August. Making Siri a one-stop shop could inoculate Apple in the scenario where they are forced to enable a search provider choice in the iOS onboarding flow by regulation. It won¡¯t do anything to help Google though, which pays Apple billions because iOS users are worth way more than any other mobile web users to its business. Perhaps another reason why making Siri the search equivalent of an overtalker is the strong play for Apple.

Summary: The law protects social media companies from being held liable for the content of users' posts. But critics of the law say it doesn't adequately hold social media companies accountable for harmful content like misinformation or hate speech. Some Republican lawmakers have also argued that social media companies embolden anti-conservative bias and have used repealing Section 230 as a threat. And days earlier, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas argued that courts should reinterpret Section 230 to give tech companies fewer protections. If Section 230 is repealed, tech companies would have to weigh whether to continue to host open forums, or to pursue less risky models.
